**SCENARIO**

As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago, the director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The team will design a new marketing strategy from these insights aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

**BUSINESS TASK**

Analyse Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends, and use insights from the analysis to determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to know how to convert casual riders into annual members.

**INSIGHT**
1. Except during the summer months of June through September, when Casual riders outnumber Members on average, Annual riders often take more rides.

2. About 54% of the total rides are taken by annual riders, leaving 46% for casual riders.

3. Even though the annual riders take more rides than the casual riders, the casual riders cover more distance and duration when riding based on a monthly and week-day basis.

4. The weekday ride visualisation reveals that the Annual riders take more rides from Monday to Friday, which may indicate that they use the service to get to and from work, while the Casual riders outnumber the Annual riders from Saturday to Sunday, which may indicate that they use the service for other purposes.

5. Both Electric and Classic bikes are popular with both Annual riders and Casual riders; but, according to the analysed result, Annual riders do not prefer the Docked type of bike, whereas Casual riders may find it tolerable.

**RECOMMEDATION**

Riders with Annual Subscriptions cover fewer kilometer and spend less time on the trip than Casual riders. This shows that Casual riders are quickly given access to the bikes. Annual members often travel the same number of kilometers every day of the week. As a result, there aren't as few motorcycles available on the weekends as there are during the workweek.

Based on these findings, I think it will be financially advantageous to convert Casual riders into Annual members. Even while weekend riding is the norm for Casual riders, there are ways to encourage them to become Annual members by offering them incentives that would increase their savings. Incentives can be designed so that because they frequently take lengthy rides and are members, they will save more money than when they are just Casual members.

Weekends and the summer season, from June to September, should receive extra attention in the marketing strategy's design. Additionally, the data that is currently available suggests that casual riders may be riding for recreation and fitness, which may indicate a younger age group that is technologically savvy, making digital media for marketing even more effective.

Before moving on with the design of the marketing campaign, further information can be gathered to further analyze, such as the age of riders to better understand them.
