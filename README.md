##SCENARIO
As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago, the director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The team will design a new marketing strategy from these insights aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

##BUSINESS TASK
Analyse Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends, and use insights from the analysis to determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to know how to convert casual riders into annual members.

##INSIGHT
Annual riders generally take more rides than the casual riders, not until the summer period between the month of June and September were the casual riders have more rides than members.
Annual riders take about 54% of the total ride while casual riders take the remaining 46%.
Even though the annual riders take more rides than the casual riders, the casual riders cover more distance and duration when riding based on a monthly and week-day basis.
From the visualisation for weekday rides, it shows that the annual riders take more rides on Mondays to Friday which can be evidence of them using it as a means of transport to work, while the casual riders surpass the annual riders from Saturday to Sunday which could be evidence of causal riders using it for leisure and fitness.
Annual riders and Casual riders like both Electric type and Classic type bikes, but annual riders do not like the docked type bike based on data available while casual riders may like it fairly based on the data available.

##RECOMMEDATION
Riders with annual subscriptions take shorter duration and distance rides than casual riders. This means that bikes are released on time for use by other riders. Members also have fairly the same number of trips regardless of the day of the week. This helps to avoid an oversupply of bikes during weekdays which can lead to a scarcity of bikes during weekends.

From these results, I believe it will make economic sense to convert casual riders to annual members. some of the ways this can be achieved even though the casual riders mostly ride on weekends is to create incentives such a way that they will save more money when they are annual members. and also since they usually go on a long ride, incentives can also be created such that with longer rides and them being members, they will save more money than when they are casual members.

The design of the marketing strategy should be focused more on weekends and also during the summer period, between the month of June to September.

And the digital media for marketing can also be better due to data available which shows that casual riders might be riding for fitness and leisure purposes which can lead to a low age group who are accustomed to technology.
